AI-Generated Python Calculator
This project features a fully functional calculator application created using Python and the tkinter library. The unique aspect of this project is that the code was generated based on a carefully crafted prompt, demonstrating the capabilities of AI in software development.
Project Overview

Prompt-Based Generation: The Python code for this calculator was created using an AI model, following a detailed prompt that specified the features and design of the application.
Functionality: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical functions, and has a user-friendly graphical interface.
Technology: Built with Python and tkinter for the GUI.

Features

Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Advanced operations: square root, square, sine, cosine
User-friendly interface with color-coded buttons
Error handling for invalid inputs
Responsive design that adapts to window resizing

Requirements

Python 3.x
tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

GenAI Prompt to create calculator.md: The detailed prompt used to generate the calculator code.
AIPromptCalC.py: The main Python script containing the calculator application code generated through GenAI.

Development Process

A comprehensive prompt was created, detailing the desired features and design of the calculator.
The prompt was fed into an AI model capable of generating Python code.
The generated code was reviewed and tested for functionality.
Minor adjustments were made to ensure all specified features were correctly implemented.
